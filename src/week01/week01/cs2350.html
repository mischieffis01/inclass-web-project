        HTML5
    </h2>
        <p>
        HTML5 is short for Hypertext Markup Language 5 and as the title descibes it is a markup language used for
        structuring and creating content for the internet
        or some might say the World Wide Web. It is the fith and final* major HTML version, but they said the same thing
        about fast and the furious 5, so lets just
        call it for what it is. The newest version and the latest version that is out. HTML5 is good to use for cross
        platform mobile application design because it
        has many low-powered features.
